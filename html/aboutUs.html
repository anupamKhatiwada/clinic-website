    <p>Tips and Advices</p>



    <p>Well oral hygiene is not only about brushing your teeth twice a day, but also about maintaining an overall good
        health. Research have proven the association of a person’s overall health and the health of the person’s mouth.

        Taking care of these few steps in your daily routine helps to maintain healthy teeth and gums.
    </p>

    <!-- <ul>
        <li> Almost everyone knows we should brush twice a day but are we brushing the right way? You should brush in
            small
            circular motions from every direction, front, back or top of each tooth for at least 2 – 3 minutes using a
            medium
            soft bristles toothbrush. Brushing your teeth removes plaques build on the teeth surface during the day.
            However
            advance the dental technology have been but brushing your teeth twice a day can never be ignored and is the
            only
            best defense again the tooth and gum problems. Remember to be gentle as brushing too aggressively can wear
            away the
            enamel of the teeth.
        </li>

        <li> Floss once a day. Floss removes the plaque from between the teeth where your toothbrush cannot reach. Floss
            in a
            slow and gentle sawing motion. Take a long piece of floss to avoid the bacteria removed from one teeth to be
            transferred into the other.
        </li>


        <li> Use a tongue scraper. After the teeth brushing bacteria can still be present on the tongue, so incorporate
            the
            habit of brushing or scraping your tongue as a part of your daily routine, this not only banish bacteria but
            also
            helps freshen your breath.
        </li>


        <li>Do not go to bed without brushing. Brushing teeth at night removes germs and plaque that accumulates
            throughout
            the day. Eating a mid-night snack can allow the food particles, sugar or carbohydrates to remain on the
            tooth for a
            long period leaving the bacteria to feed on produce acid leading the chances of tooth decay.
        </li>


        <li>Use fluorinated toothpaste and mouthwash. Fluoride helps in hardening the tooth enamel hence reducing the
            risk of
            decay. However too much of fluoride can cause white spots on teeth. Seek your dentist’s advice for the right
            toothpaste with the right amount of fluoride in it.
        </li>


        <li> Keep your toothbrush clean and change the toothbrush every 4-5 months. Always keeps your brush away from
            your
            toilet and make insects cannot reach the toothbrush and rinse the brush with lukewarm water before use.
        </li>


        <li>People with braces need to use special toothbrushes and other oral hygiene kits for brushing. Talk to your
            dentist
            during the treatment for the same.</li>



        <li>Parents should brush their children’s teeth till the age of 5 and good oral hygiene habits should be
            introduced
            into the child from a very young age. Do not overlook the issue of the milk teeth thinking they are anyway
            going
            to
            fall off. A good oral hygiene during the milk teeth is very important for a good set of permanent teeth.
        </li>



        <li>Do not use any tobacco products or smoke. Smoking can stain your teeth yellow, cause bad breath and
            increases
            the
            risk of gum diseases.</li>



        <li>Limit alcoholic drinks. Alcohol can erode the outer layer of your teeth, causing loss of enamel and
            increasing
            the
            sensitivity.</li>



        <li>Drink lots of water. Drinking water is not only good for your overall health but also increases saliva
            production
            which is important for your oral health.</li>



        <li>Limit sugary or acidic foods and drinks or we can eat smart. Plaque which constantly forms on the teeth is a
            film
            of bacteria and this bacteria reacts with the sugary food or drinks to produce acids which further attacks
            the
            tooth
            enamel opening the door to decay. If you want to have something sugary it is advised to eat it for dessert
            and
            then
            brush your teeth.</li>



        <li>See your dentist at least once or twice a year. Professional cleaning of your teeth at least once a year
            increases
            the longevity of your teeth and gums as the doctors removes plaque build –up that we can’t brush or floss
            away.
            Regular checkup also help in spotting early sign of oral cancer, wear and tear from tooth grinding, and
            allergies
            from any medication or other signs of gum diseases.</li>



        <li>Use antibiotics only under prescription and avoid self-medication. Consult your dentist in case of
            toothache,
            swelling or bleeding gums as this could be early signs of any major issues</li>



        <li>Bleeding gums are the initial waring of gingivitis and is caused due to the accumulation of plaque on the
            teeth
            layer. Do not ignore this warning and visit your dentist for a professional cleaning. Gingivitis sign also
            include
            redness and swelling of the gums and thankfully this is reversible if treated early.</li>
